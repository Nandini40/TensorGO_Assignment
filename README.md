AI Assistant: Speech-to-Speech Response Using LLM
This project is an AI-powered assistant that converts speech input to a text response using a language model (LLM) and then generates a spoken response. The system uses AssemblyAI for speech recognition, Ollama for natural language processing, and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech synthesis. Additionally, it integrates a webcam to capture video input from the user.

Features
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken language into text using AssemblyAI's real-time transcription.
Natural Language Processing: Processes the transcribed text and generates a response using a language model.
Text-to-Speech: Converts the generated text response back into speech using ElevenLabs.
Webcam Integration: Captures video input from the user in real-time.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Pip (Python package installer)
Required Libraries
Install the necessary Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install assemblyai elevenlabs ollama opencv-python pyaudio numpy
PortAudio Installation
On Ubuntu/Debian:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install libportaudio2
On macOS (using Homebrew):
bash
Copy code
brew install portaudio
On Windows:
You can install it through Conda if you're using Anaconda:
bash
Copy code
conda install -c anaconda portaudio
Alternatively, you can manually download and install the PortAudio library from the PortAudio Downloads.

API Keys
You'll need API keys for AssemblyAI and ElevenLabs:

AssemblyAI API Key: Sign up on AssemblyAI to get your API key.
ElevenLabs API Key: Sign up on ElevenLabs to get your API key.
Setting Up the API Keys
Replace the placeholders in the code with your actual API keys:

python
Copy code
aai.settings.api_key = "your_assemblyai_api_key_here"  # AssemblyAI API key
self.client = ElevenLabs(api_key="your_elevenlabs_api_key_here")  # ElevenLabs API key
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python ai_assistant.py
Interaction:

Speak into your microphone to interact with the AI assistant.
The webcam feed will be displayed in a window. You can close the webcam window by pressing the 'q' key.
Troubleshooting
PortAudio Library Not Found: Ensure that PortAudio is installed on your system. Follow the installation instructions above based on your OS.
PyAudio Installation Issues: On some systems, installing PyAudio can be tricky. If you encounter issues, consider using a precompiled wheel from PyAudio's unofficial repository.
